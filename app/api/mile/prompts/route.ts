**User Locale Context:**
- Language: {{USER_LANGUAGE}}

2. Understand city names in the user's language (e.g., "北京" = Beijing, "東京" = Tokyo)
3. Handle currency mentions appropriately
4. Interpret relative dates based on the user's timezone

**Today's date: {{TODAY}}**

## Extraction Rules

**1. Transportation (CRITICAL - extract from/to cities carefully):**
- "flew from London to Tokyo" → from: "London", to: "Tokyo"
- "flew to Paris" → from: null, to: "Paris"
- "flight from Beijing to Shanghai" → from: "Beijing", to: "Shanghai"
- "rental car from LA" -> from: "Los Angeles", mode: "rental car"
- Keywords for mode: flew/flight/plane → "flight", train/rail → "train", drove/car/road trip → "car", rental car -> "rental car", bus/coach → "bus", boat/ferry/ship/cruise → "boat", bike/cycle → "bike", walk/walked/hike → "walk"

**2. Accommodations (CRITICAL - extract hotel name with proper capitalization):**
- ALWAYS capitalize hotel/property names properly (Title Case)
- "stay in beijing season hotel" → name: "Beijing Season Hotel"
- "stay in hilton london hotel" → name: "Hilton London Hotel"
- "stayed at hotel marriott" → name: "Hotel Marriott"
- "stay in London Hilton for 2 nights" → name: "London Hilton", nights: 2
- "two nights at Hyatt" → name: "Hyatt", nights: 2
- "staying at Airbnb" → type: "airbnb"
- Pattern: "stay in X hotel" or "stay at X hotel" → extract X as the hotel name, properly capitalized
- Keywords: hotel, stay, stayed, staying, Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt, Airbnb, hostel, 酒店, 民宿
- Duration keywords: "for X nights", "X nights", "two/three/four nights"

**3. Date Calculation for Accommodations (CRITICAL):**
- When nights are specified, ALWAYS calculate checkOut from checkIn:
  checkOut = checkIn + nights days
- If no checkIn date is mentioned, use the transportation arrival date as checkIn
- Example: Arrived {{LAST_TUESDAY}} + 2 nights → checkOut = {{TUESDAY_PLUS_2}}
- "for two nights" starting {{LAST_TUESDAY}} → checkIn: "{{LAST_TUESDAY}}", checkOut: "{{TUESDAY_PLUS_2}}", nights: 2

**4. Places/Attractions:**
- "visited the Eiffel Tower" → name: "Eiffel Tower"
- "saw Big Ben" → name: "Big Ben"
- Keywords: visited, saw, went to, toured, explored, 参观, 游览

**5. Travel Companions:**
- "traveling with John" → companions: ["John"]
- "with my wife Sarah" → companions: ["Sarah"]
- "with Chris and Adam" → companions: ["Chris", "Adam"]
- Keywords: with, traveling with, together with

**6. Date Parsing (use the reference dates above):**
- "last Saturday" → {{LAST_SATURDAY}}
- "yesterday" → {{YESTERDAY}}
- "last Monday" → {{LAST_MONDAY}}
- "last Tuesday" → {{LAST_TUESDAY}}
- "today" → {{TODAY}}

## User's description (extract ALL details):
"{{USER_INPUT}}"

IMPORTANT:
- Extract the EXACT city names mentioned (from: departure city, to: destination city)
- ALWAYS include country codes (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) for all cities (e.g., Tokyo → JP, London → GB, Paris → FR, Beijing → CN, Singapore → SG)
- Use the reference dates provided above for relative dates
- Extract hotel names with PROPER CAPITALIZATION (Title Case): "beijing season hotel" → "Beijing Season Hotel"
- ALWAYS calculate checkOut date: checkOut = checkIn + nights
- "two nights" = 2, "three nights" = 3, "a week" = 7
- Return empty arrays if nothing found for that category`

/**
 * Calendar Event Parser Prompt Template
 */
const CALENDAR_EVENT_PROMPT = `Extract transportation segments and accommodations from these calendar events grouped by trips.

**User Locale Context:**
- Language: {{USER_LANGUAGE}}
- Region: {{USER_REGION}}
- Timezone: {{USER_TIMEZONE}}

Use this locale context to interpret city names and dates correctly.

Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:

{
  "trips": [
    {
      "tripIndex": 1,
      "segments": [
        {
          "mode": "flight|train|bus|car",
          "from": "city name or null",
          "to": "city name or null",
          "date": "ISO 8601 date",
          "flightNumber": "flight number or null"

          "nights": number
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Rules for extracting cities:
- Use the Location field to identify cities
- For flights: "Amsterdam → Porto" or "AMS - OPO" means from Amsterdam to Porto
- For trains: "Porto to Lisbon" means from Porto to Lisbon
- If only destination is mentioned (e.g., "Train to Porto"), use the PREVIOUS event's location or destination as origin
- For hotel stays: extract city from location or hotel name
- Flight numbers often indicate routes: "KL 1573" with location "Amsterdam Airport" means departing from Amsterdam
- ALWAYS try to infer origin city from context, previous events, or location field
- Only use null if city is truly unknown after all context analysis

Rules for filtering:
- Only extract actual transportation (flights, trains, buses, ferries) and hotel stays
- Skip work meetings, calls, conferences, presentations, town halls, webinars
- Skip restaurant reservations, social events, appointments
- Skip events without clear travel intent

Examples:
- "Flight KL 1573" with location "Amsterdam Airport" → from: "Amsterdam", mode: "flight"
- "Train to Lisbon" following event in Porto → from: "Porto", to: "Lisbon"
- "Porto → Lisbon" → from: "Porto", to: "Lisbon"
- "Moxy Lisbon City" → accommodation in Lisbon

Calendar events (grouped by trip):
{{CALENDAR_EVENTS}}

IMPORTANT: Return one entry in the "trips" array for each trip that contains valid travel data. Skip trips with no transportation or accommodations. Preserve the tripIndex for reference.`
